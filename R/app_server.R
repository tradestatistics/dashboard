  # Safety net: onSessionEnded() only fires on a normal session/websocket
  # disconnect. If the R process itself is quit (e.g. Ctrl+C out of run_app()
  # then q()) without that event ever firing, the connection is instead swept
  # up by R's final garbage collection while still open, which produces a
  # warning on exit. The finalizer is registered on `con` itself (not on
  # environment(), which has no other strong referents and would become
  # collectible - and thus close the connection mid-session - as soon as
  # app_server() returns): the module server closures below hold a real,
  # strong reference to `con` for as long as they're alive, so this only
  # fires once nothing is using the connection anymore or R exits.
  #
  # reg.finalizer() requires its target to be an environment or an external
  # pointer - a DBIConnection is an S4 object, not either of those, so we
  # target con@ptr (the external pointer slot embedded in `con`) instead.
  # That slot stays reachable for exactly as long as `con` itself does (it's
  # part of `con`'s own data), so this preserves the same lifetime guarantee.
